#### **FOREWORD**

It gives me great pleasure to officially release the final results of the Economic Census of Cambodia 2022 (EC2022). This nationwide census was conducted from 1 March 2022 to 31 March 2022, with 1 March as the reference date. It is the second establishment listing conducted as a complete count. The first Economic Census was conducted by the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC), with the support of the Japan International Cooperation Agency, in 2011.

Conducted in compliance with the legal bases set out in the Statistics Law, and Sub-Decree No. 151 dated 2 October 2019, the EC2022 compiles basic statistics on economic activities throughout Cambodia. This information is useful for a variety of stakeholders, including policymakers, national and local or subnational governments, non-governmental organizations, private sector actors, academics, researchers, and development and trade partners. The census data is also an important input for calculating estimates of Cambodia's gross domestic product.

This national report will help inform policy formulation and program development towards achieving more substantive deconcentration and decentralization reform in Cambodia. The results will contribute to the socioeconomic development goals of the RGC in supporting the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics, including statistics-based planning and evidence-based policymaking. I am therefore confident that the census results provide valuable information and insights into socioeconomic development in Cambodia.

I would like to express my profound gratitude to **Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo HUN SEN, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia,** for the unwavering support provided to the Ministry of Planning (MoP) throughout the conduct of the census.

The Economic Census is one of the largest statistical data exercises in Cambodia, involving the collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of data on economic activities nationwide. This huge undertaking would not have been possible without the support and cooperation of all stakeholders. The people I would like to thank are too numerous to list, but the following deserve special mention.

First, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to senior officers and staff members of the MoP and the National Institute of Statistics (NIS), as well as to members of the 2021 National Committee for Economic Census and the 2021 Technical Committee for Economic Census, for their steadfast participation throughout the conduct of the census. I am especially indebted to enumerators and supervisors for their dedication and hard work. My sincere gratitude also goes to the staff of line ministries and other related government institutions, as well as the governor of Phnom Penh, provincial and district governors, and commune and village chiefs. Their contributions enabled the successful completion of the EC2022.

I extend my sincere appreciation to the many business and enterprise representatives for sparing their valuable time to participate in the census and for providing information on establishment listings. I am grateful to the World Bank for technical assistance and to the Australian Government for financial support. For informing the public about the 2022 census campaign, my special thanks go to the media, including newspapers, radio and television.

I am grateful to H.E. Rin Virak, Stand-in Secretary of State of the MOP and Director of the 2021 Technical Committee for Economic Census, and H.E. Ms. Hang Lina, Delegate of the RGC and Director General of the NIS, whose leadership and dedication delivered a successful census. But this

could not have been achieved without the assistance of senior officers within the NIS, notably H.E. Chhay Satia, H.E. Khin Song, H.E. Saint Lundy, Mr. Phan Chinda, and Mr. Vern Thy, all of whom are Deputy Director Generals, H.E. Nor Vanndy, Director of the Economic Statistics Department, Mr. Chao Pheav, Director of the Data Management, Application Development and Technology Department, Mr. Ly Sophanith, Director of the Information and Communication Technology Department, and Mr. So Tonnere, Deputy Director of the Economic Statistics Department.

#### 10. Enumerators

The NIS employed 5,326 temporary enumerators to carry out the EC2022. Each enumerator was assigned one or two villages, or alternatively one enumeration area. Refer to the Enumerators' Manual (available at <a href="https://nada.nis.gov.kh/index.php/nis-nada">https://nada.nis.gov.kh/index.php/nis-nada</a>) for the demarcation of enumeration areas.

#### 11. Supervisors

The NIS employed 499 temporary supervisors. Each supervisor was tasked to oversee a team of several enumerators, as described in the Supervisors' Manual (available at <a href="https://nada.nis.gov.kh/index.php/nis-nada">https://nada.nis.gov.kh/index.php/nis-nada</a>).

#### 12. Training of local staff, supervisors and enumerators

- 1. The NIS provided two sets of training to provincial staff at the MoP: a two-day training course on 14 and 15 December 2021, and a five-day training workshop from 17 to 21 January 2022.

- 5. The TOTs acted as regional officers and assistant regional officers for the duration of the data collection stage.

#### 13. Mapping

The village boundary maps used in the census were drawn based on the village maps from Cambodia's 2019 Population Census. Large villages with numerous establishments were divided into enumeration areas for which enumeration area maps were drawn. Both maps were used to instruct enumerators about their assigned enumeration areas.

#### 14. Pre-test and pilot surveys

- 1. Pre-test
  - a) The pre-testing of the questionnaire was carried out from 22 to 26 November 2021 in three different regions: Phnom Penh, Svay Rieng and Takeo.
  - b) The aim was to test various components of the EC2022, including the questionnaire design, enumeration methods, and the Enumerators' Manual.
  - c) Results from the pre-tests helped to finalize the instruments of the EC2022.

#### 2. Pilot surveys

- a) Pilot surveys were conducted from 1 to 12 December 2021 in approximately 100 villages/enumeration areas, selected using sampling theory and covering all provinces.
- b) All large establishments (100 or more persons engaged) in the selected villages/areas were enumerated.
- c) The aims were to:
  - (1) Test the final drafts of the census form and other documents
  - (2) Test the work procedures, guiding at each stage of enumeration the enumerators, supervisors, local or sub-national government personnel and NIS staff
  - (3) Test the tabulation methods to be adopted
  - (4) Collect statistical data on small, medium and large enterprises.

#### 15. Submission of documents

- 2. Provincial census officers inspected and submitted all EC2022-related documents to NIS census officials before 20 April 2022.

#### 16. Tabulation and data processing

1. Preliminary results

The completed establishment lists and summary sheets were reviewed and data entered into the computers located on NIS premises. The data was tabulated and presented as the preliminary results of the EC2022.

#### 2. Final results

- a) Provincial teams edited and coded the data manually at the NIS, concurrently with the NIS's procurement of completed census forms and EC2022-related documents. These documents were filed systematically and kept in secure storage on the NIS premises.
- b) Provincial teams entered and then edited the data manually on computers at the NIS. This data cleaning process involved identifying and fixing incomplete, incorrect, duplicate or erroneous data in a data set.

#### 3. Analysis of results

The results were analyzed from various viewpoints.

#### 4. Census Atlas

Statistical maps of the entire territory of Cambodia and of each province were drawn.

#### 5. Directory of establishments

A database containing information about establishments, entities, and administrative area codes was constructed as the sampling frame for economic survey sampling, and also for other uses.

#### 17. Dissemination

The EC2022 results were released to the public through dissemination workshops and the media, including newspapers and the internet, on the following dates:

- 1. Preliminary results in January 2023
- 2. Final results in October 2023

#### 18. Statistical tables

- 1. Cross-tabulation of distributional statistics for different categories: number of persons engaged, sex of representative, main business activity, and province.
- 2. Average number of persons engaged per establishment, average sales and expenses per entity or enterprise.

#### 19. Safekeeping of census forms and related documents

The census forms and other related documents were in the express care of enumerators, supervisors, and were securely stored at local or subnational government offices and subsequently at the NIS, in compliance with Article 22 of the Statistics Law.

#### 20. Post-census work

- 1. To identify and rectify any coverage problems and content errors in the EC2022, a post-enumeration survey was conducted in May 2022 in 100 villages selected using sampling theory.
- 2. The Cambodia Inter-censal Economic Survey is planned for March 2026, using the Directory of Establishments constructed from the EC2022. The aim is to provide updated statistics on the economic activities of establishments and enterprises in Cambodia, and at the same time to enhance the capacity and capability of the NIS to conduct economic censuses and surveys.

#### **Explanation of Terms**

The numbers in parentheses refer to questions on the census form.

#### **Establishment**

An establishment is a business or enterprise that occupies a particular building, premises or place where its economic activities are performed, and fulfills the following conditions in principle:

- (1) It is a place which occupies a certain space (one plot) and in which economic activities are performed under a single manager.
- (2) It has equipment, engages one or more persons, and produces and/or sells goods or provides services on a continuous basis.

The International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Rev.4 of the United Nations defines an establishment as "an enterprise, or part of an enterprise, that is situated in a single location and in which only a single (non-ancillary) productive activity is carried out or in which the principal productive activity accounts for most of the value added".

There are three kinds of establishments: fixed, movable, and mobile. Fixed establishments always perform economic activities in a fixed place or building. Movable establishments always carry out economic activity in a fixed place but can easily move to another place. And mobile establishments carry out business on the move. This report includes street business.

#### Coverage

The EC2022 covered establishments in all but two ISIC sections, excluding Section A (Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery) and Section I (Household Activities).

After over a year of data processing and analysis, the final results of the EC2022 were released in August 2023 and are summarized below:

#### 1. Total number of establishments was 753,670

As of 1 March 2022, there were 753,670 establishments in Cambodia. The number of persons engaged in these establishments totaled 2,980,569, comprising 1,139,207 (38.2%) males and 1,841,362 (61.8%) females (Table 1.1 and Table 11.1.1). Excluding street businesses, the number of establishments amounted to 676,597 and the number of persons engaged in these establishments amounted to 2,864,256 (Table 1.7.1 and Table 11.7.1).

Compared with the results of EC2011, the number of establishments in 2022 increased by around 49%, with an annual growth rate of 3.7%. During the same period, the number of persons engaged increased by 70.9%, resulting in an annual increase of 5.0%, which was significantly higher than the population growth rate of around 1.4%.

Cambodian-owned establishments accounted for 99.1% of all establishments in Cambodia in 2022 (Table 2.2.1 and Table 2.2.3). Of the total number of establishments, 747,010 (99.1%) were owned by Cambodians, 2,608 (0.3%) by Chinese, 1,581 (0.2%) by Vietnamese, 1,198 (0.2%) by other Asian nationalities, and 439 (0.1%) by South Koreans. Overall, the share of foreign-owned establishments throughout Cambodia was less than 1%. A similar pattern was observed in 2011, when Cambodian-owned establishments accounted for 98.9% of all establishments.

Compared to EC2011, the number of establishments excluding street businesses increased by 213,234 (46%), while the number of street businesses increased by 35,302 (84%). This suggests that street businesses experienced a higher growth rate than other establishment types between 2011 and 2022.

#### 2. Establishments engaging one or two persons accounted for more than 80%

Of the total number of establishments, 621,028 or 82.4% engaged one or two persons, and 253,857 (33.7%) engaged two persons. Thus, small businesses engaging one or two persons accounted for the majority of the total (Table 1.1).

Establishments engaging five or more persons formed the next largest group, accounting for 53,724 (7.2%) of the total, followed by 20,820 (2.8%) with 10 or more persons, 1,870 (0.2%) with 100 or more persons, and only 295 establishments with 1,000 or more persons. Therefore, large establishments accounted for a very low proportion (Table 1.1).

At the same time, the number of persons engaged in establishments with five or more persons engaged was around 1.84 million, accounting for 61.9% of the total persons engaged, followed by 1.63 million (55.0%) in establishments with 10 or more persons engaged, 1.21 million (40.8%) in those with 100 or more persons engaged and only 663,426 persons (22.3%) in establishments with 1,000 or more persons engaged.

#### 5. Sole proprietorship accounted for 96.5%

Sole proprietorship or physical person establishments amounted to 734,739, accounting for 96.5% of all establishments in 2022 (Table 1.4.1). This implies that most establishments in Cambodia were owned and operated by one person. Additionally, the number of persons engaged in these establishments was 2,814,775, accounting for 94% of total persons engaged (Table 11.4.1). This result is almost the same as that in EC2011, when sole proprietorship also accounted for the vast majority (96%) of establishments.

This high-cost structure of Cambodia's industry and service sectors could be due to the country's heavy reliance on imports of materials and goods, combined with relatively low domestic production. To promote domestic production and move away from this high-cost economy, it is critical for Cambodia to address this issue as part of its future socioeconomic development (Table 21.1, Table 24.1 and Table 27.1).

# 21. Around 81% of establishments, including those in manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and accommodation and food service activities, reported being affected by the Covid-19 pandemic

The pandemic crisis has had significant negative impacts on business activities, including decreased revenue, increased expenditure, decline in market demand, and a lack of working capital. Among the establishments affected by the pandemic, 587,793 (34.8%)<sup>9</sup> reported lower revenues in 2022, 433,703 (26.6%) reported higher expenditures, 212,760 (12.6%) reported declines in market demand and 153,878 (9.1%) reported a lack of working capital (Table 5.1).

<sup>-</sup>

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>9</sup> This percentage is the share of the number of cases for that category to total reported cases. Each establishment could report more than one case because it was a multiple-choice question.
